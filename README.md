## Student Letter Grade Calculator

### The purpose of this program is to calculate the grade a student has based off of an input decimal percentage received in the course. (.84 is a B, .54 is an F).

### The expected output of this program is the Letter Grade the student recieves for their decimal percentage.

### This program execution is sequential, followed by a 'main' function.

### This program could be improved by adding in more values and adjustments. Possibly inputing in different forms of outputs in the code.

## Days in Month Index

### The purpose of this program is to display the number of days in an input month. Like 31 days in August or 29 on Feburary ( as of 2024). 

### The expected output of this program is the number of days in the input month.

### This program is sequential as well, followed by a 'main' function. There is an index prior to this function that lists off the months and their numbers.

### One way this program could be improved is by adding in an option for a leap year. This would remove the need to refer to what year the program's index is set to.
